### New Characters info:

> **Nakaki Kurumi** - The victim of Turnabout Fly High, a character involved in the first case of the Gyakuten Saiban in Joypolis attraction.

> **Rando Daiba** - The victim of Turnabout Locked Room, a character central to the mystery in the second original case of the attraction.

> **Yumi Temgashiwa** - A veteran actress and high-ranking member of Joypolis, she is the victim in Turnabout Don. Known for her successful career and dedication to the entertainment industry, she was an obstacle to Kogyoin Don's attempts to acquire control of Joypolis.

> **Kogyoin Don** - A former martial artist turned celebrity and entertainment mogul. Standing at 6'4" (195 cm), Don is known for his incredible strength and intimidating presence. He attempted to take over Joypolis to complete his entertainment empire but was thwarted by Yumi Temgashiwa. In his arrogance, Don murdered Temgashiwa during a film production at the Joypolis Coliseum, using a real glass pot during what was supposed to be a staged fight scene. His defining characteristic is his intense, glowing yellow-eyed glare that could intimidate anyone. Despite his wealth and influence, he was ultimately brought to justice by Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth.
