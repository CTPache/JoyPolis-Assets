## Current Status

Due to the attraction's discontinuation in 2015 and the limited preservation efforts that followed, documentation for Gyakuten Kenji is significantly less complete than Gyakuten Saiban. What materials we have are primarily:

- **Promotional artwork and posters** - Marketing materials for the attraction
- **Background images** - Scene backgrounds from the attraction
- **Episode-specific materials** - Basic documentation for each of the three episodes

**Note:** Unlike the Gyakuten Saiban materials which have been extensively recreated and translated, the Gyakuten Kenji assets remain largely in their original form or as basic reference materials.

## Contributing

If you have materials from the Gyakuten Kenji attraction, we would greatly appreciate contributions including:

- **Artwork and screenshots** - Photos from the attraction or promotional materials
- **Character artwork** - Sprites, character designs, or CG artwork
- **Storyline information** - Details about the episodes or cases
- **Dialogue transcripts** - Original Japanese text or English translations
- **Game footage** - Recorded gameplay or documentation
- **Booklets or programs** - Official promotional materials

Even partial materials would help expand what we have for this discontinued but historically important attraction!
